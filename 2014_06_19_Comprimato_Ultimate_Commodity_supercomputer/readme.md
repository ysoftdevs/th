Ultimate Commodity supercomputer
================================

First computer capable to deliver more 1 TFLOPS of computing power was Intelâ€™s ASCI Red supercomputer. It consisted of about 7904 CPUs that required 850 kW of power and about 150 m2 of floor space. The ASCI Red was the fastest supercomputer in years 1997 - 2000. Today, single GPU board can deliver more than 5 TFLOPS within 250W power envelope. During the talk we will introduce GPU computing concept, current GPU programming models, and we will show how to install GPU programming environment. One simple and one more complex visual example will demonstrate that programing for massively parallel processor is actually pretty easy. Using simple C constructs, we will easily dominate thousands of parallel computing threads.
